# COMP0037: Robot Navigation and Planning

The project uses simulation data to manage an autonomous robot tasked with cleaning specific zones within a busy airport setting. The robot uses various planning algorithms to navigate efficiently while avoiding high-cost areas and optimizing battery usage across different charging stations.

## Repository Structure

- `/code` - Python scripts for running simulations, including path planning and robot control algorithms.
- `/save` - saved policies and figures
- `report.pdf` - Contains the project report and additional documentation on the coursework.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**
- **A-Star (A*) Algorithm**
- **Markov Decision Processes (FMDP)** for handling uncertainties in robot motion.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed along with required packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `joblib`.
